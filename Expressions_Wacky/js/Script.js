/*As we finish up our second week in our web programming fundamentals
class it is becoming apparent how much fun this class is. For me, it
has been several years since I have written anything in code. Not only
has this class been nostalgic but also engaging. I was pleasantly
surprised at the eagerness of my fellow classmates on their interaction
and helpfulness with one another. Moving forward I continue to have
high hopes for what has yet to come.
